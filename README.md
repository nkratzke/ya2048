# Yet another 2048 game

- Author: Nane Kratzke, LÃ¼beck University of Applied Sciences
- Purpose: A demonstration game for my Webtech course (Computer Science study programme)

This game is an implementation of the famous 
[2048](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2048_(video_game)) game first published by
Gabriele Cirulli.  The main purpose of this game implementation is 
to demonstrate several aspects of client side programming 
using [Dart](https://www.dartlang.org/) including:

- Key-based control for desktop usage
- Swipe-based control for mobile usage
- CSS animations to indicate impossible folds by shaking
- CSS animations to indicate successful folds by sliding
- Web storage (localstorage) to realize a permanent client-side highscore
- Offline usage by making use of service workers and the [PWA](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/pwa) package
- Viewport related scaling

You can [play](https://www.nkode.io/assets/webtech/demos/ya2048/) this game here:
